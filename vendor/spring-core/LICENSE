A "contribution" is the original Software, or any additions or changes to the
Software.

A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
license.

"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its
contribution.

2. Grant of Rights

(A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the

non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its
contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
contribution or any derivative works that you create.

(B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to
make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of
its contribution in the Software or derivative works of the contribution in the
Software.

3. Conditions and Limitations

(A) No Trademark License - This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you
claim are infringed by the Software, your patent license from such contributor

object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this
license.

(E) The Software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The
contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have
additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot
change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude
the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.

only to the Software or derivative works that you create that run on a Microsoft
Windows operating system product, a Linux operating system product, or a macOS
